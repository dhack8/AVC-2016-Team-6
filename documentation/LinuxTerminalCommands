1) To start "ssh" (see Raspberry IP for command, instructions, and current IP)

2) next "ls" to see the files and folders in the current directory

3) next "cd" (stands for change directory)
  usage: cd <folder name here> (moves you to that folder)
  example: cd E101/Curiosity/Curiosity_1/AVC...
  you can use tab to auto complete folder names
  eg. cd E <press tab here> -> cd E101/
      cd E101/C <press tab here> -> cd E101/Curiosity

4) to git clone: type "sudo git clone https://github.com/dhack8/AVC-2016-Team-6"
    This will create a new directory called AVC-2016-Team-6 if one does not already exist
    Make sure you commit changes on github before git cloning!!

5) to edit a file use "nano"
    Usage: sudo nano <file name here> (opens that file in the nano editor)
    eg. sudo nano Curiosity8.cpp
    to save and exit ctrl+x, then press y to say yes to saving, then enter to accept the file name
    ^ means CTRL in nano (and linux terminal in general)
    
6) You need to compile your code before you can run it. Use "gcc".
  usage: sudo gcc -o <output name> <input file> -l<library you want to include>
  eg. sudo gcc -o main Curiosity8.cpp -lE101 (this compiles Curiosity8.cpp into a program called main
  
7) To run the program use "./"
  usage: sudo ./<compiled file name>
  eg. sudo ./main (This will run main on the Pi. Make sure you're ready for it to run.)

8) To stop it running, use CTRL+C
    It will display a ^C
    and then should stop
    
Handy tip: you /CAN/ paste in terminal, use CTRL+SHIFT+V instead of just CTRL+V
Extra handy tip: this works for copy too. CTRL+SHIFT+C
