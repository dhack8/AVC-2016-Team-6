###Week 1 Checklist
- [x] Everyone: Review Week 1 checklist.
- [x] Santhu: Finishing plan (checked by David).
- [x] David: Figure out room availabilty.
- [x] Tim: Read up on gate opening stuff.
- [x] Max & Chris: Fabrication of prototype robot.
- [x] Santhu & Tim: Learning how to SSH into the Raspberry Pi from another computer. (Learn also about gitclone)
- [x] Chris: Explain the frankenstein prototpye to coders.
- [x] Santhu & Tim: Get both wheels to turn (also potentially figure out primitive turning by making them go in opposite directions)
- [x] David: Check all this stuff is done.
- [x] Max & Chris: Plan next prototype, Maybe check with codders about what there needs are/ problems with first prototype.
- [x] David: Figure out what the hell we can do in week 2!

###Week 1 Review
Everything appears to have been completed, no problems

###Week 2 Checklist
- [x] Coders: Play around with code that you think will help, think about the problem in your showers :)
- [x] Hardware: Plan 2nd prototype completetly so its ready to be fabricated first week back.

This weeks task a rather light due to the fact that none of us can get hands on with the hardware, which makes it difficult for both parties to be super porductive.

###Week 2 Review
To be filled out.

###Week 3 Checklist
- [x] Everyone: This is week 3 !, in the plan we said we would finish quads 1 & 2 this week.
- [x] Santhu & Tim: Make robot perform 90 degree turns to the right and left.
- [x] Santhu & Tim: Make robot perform 180 degree turns to the right and left.
- [ ] Santhu & Tim: Make robot perform slight left and right turns while still going forwards (use multiplier like we will with the error signal).
- [x] Santhu & Tim: Once you get all the turns working show David.
- [ ] Santhu & Tim: Play around with distance sensors to see how they work.
- [x] Tim: make gate open.
- [x] Chris & Max: ~~Fabricate 2nd prototype.~~ (Just plan it).
- [x] Chris & Max: Your workload might be light this week, so once youve done the prototype see where else you can help out.
- [x] David: Refine code for first 3 Quadrants.
- [x] David: ~~Start code for maze.~~ ( Reserching PID instead ).
- [x] Everyone: Actually get robot on board for first trial run.

###Week 3 Review
Everything has been completed aside from the distance senors and forward turning but im sure this will be done next week

###Week 4 Checklist
- [x] Team metting monday to sort checklist.
- [x] Programmers: PID. (Did p and d dont need i)
- [x] David: Right quick PID programe early in the week.
- [x] Everyone: Test and complete quadrant 2.
- [ ] Hardware: Print parts for 2nd proto.
- [ ] Hardware: Fabricate proto.
- [x] As individuals: Progress report.
- [x] Everyone: Progress report meeting, make sure everyone is on the same page.

 
###Week 4 Review
We have made great progress this week robot gets to the start of quad 3, Hardware guys still havnt produced a final prototype, but this is of little concern for the current prototype is very solid and we are in no rush for the next.

###Week 5 Checklist
- [x] Everyone: Hand in progress report on monday.
- [ ] Programmers: Get through quadrants 1-3.
- [ ] Programmers: Write code for detecting maze intersections etc.
- [x] Programmers: write code for 90 degree turns
- [x] Programmers: Work on some conceptual code for quad 4.
- [ ] Hardware: Final prototpye has been delayed a lot, it needs to be this week.
- [x] Hardware: Print out final chassis.
- [ ] Hardware: Fabricate final prototpye.


###Week 5 Review
Not the best week, David and Santhu are behind with quadrant 3, final prototype has been printed but not put together yet.

###Week 6 Checklist
- [ ] Hardware: Fabricate robot on monday. top proority.
- [ ] Hardware: Once done you will be assigned to Programming team B (Tim Max Chris).
- [ ] Santhu and David: Assigned to Programming team A (Santhu David).
- [ ] Programming team B: Working on quadrant 4 code.
- [ ] Programming team A: Working on finishing quadrant 3 code.

Teams its probaby best that we keep out code in seperate files for the moment, that will make testing the code a whole lot easier, for example team B can just run there code from the start of the maze and not worry about line following. Then we will stitch all the code together. I recommend looking at curiosity 3 as some code in there may help. also elf might give us some helpfull hints on quad 4 this week (but i doubt it) however you should look at his avc wiki.
