- [x] Max & Chris: Plan next prototype, Maybe check with codders about what there needs are/ problems with first prototype.
- [x] David: Figure out what the hell we can do in week 2!

###Week 1 Review
Everything appears to have been completed, no problems

###Week 2 Checklist
- [ ] Codders: Play around with code that you tink will help, think about the problem in your showers :)
- [ ] Hardware: Plan 2nd prototype completetly so its ready to be fabricated first week back.

This weeks task a rather light due to the fact that none of us can get hands on with the hardware, which makes it difficult for both parties to be super porductive.
