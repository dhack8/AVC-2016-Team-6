###Week 1 Checklist
- [x] Everyone: Review Week 1 checklist.
- [x] Santhu: Finishing plan (checked by David).
- [x] David: Figure out room availabilty.
- [x] Tim: Read up on gate opening stuff.
- [x] Max & Chris: Fabrication of prototype robot.
- [x] Santhu & Tim: Learning how to SSH into the Raspberry Pi from another computer. (Learn also about gitclone)
- [x] Chris: Explain the frankenstein prototpye to coders.
- [x] Santhu & Tim: Get both wheels to turn (also potentially figure out primitive turning by making them go in opposite directions)
- [x] David: Check all this stuff is done.
- [x] Max & Chris: Plan next prototype, Maybe check with codders about what there needs are/ problems with first prototype.
- [x] David: Figure out what the hell we can do in week 2!

###Week 1 Review
Everything appears to have been completed, no problems

###Week 2 Checklist
- [x] Coders: Play around with code that you think will help, think about the problem in your showers :)
- [x] Hardware: Plan 2nd prototype completetly so its ready to be fabricated first week back.

This weeks task a rather light due to the fact that none of us can get hands on with the hardware, which makes it difficult for both parties to be super porductive.

###Week 2 Review
To be filled out.

###Week 3 Checklist
- [x] Everyone: This is week 3 !, in the plan we said we would finish quads 1 & 2 this week.
- [x] Santhu & Tim: Make robot perform 90 degree turns to the right and left.
- [x] Santhu & Tim: Make robot perform 180 degree turns to the right and left.
- [ ] Santhu & Tim: Make robot perform slight left and right turns while still going forwards (use multiplier like we will with the error signal).
- [x] Santhu & Tim: Once you get all the turns working show David.
- [ ] Santhu & Tim: Play around with distance sensors to see how they work.
- [x] Tim: make gate open.
- [x] Chris & Max: ~~Fabricate 2nd prototype.~~ (Just plan it).
- [x] Chris & Max: Your workload might be light this week, so once youve done the prototype see where else you can help out.
- [x] David: Refine code for first 3 Quadrants.
- [x] David: ~~Start code for maze.~~ ( Reserching PID instead ).
- [x] Everyone: Actually get robot on board for first trial run.

###Week 3 Review

###Week 4 Checklist
